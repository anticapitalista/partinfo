Description: Tool to list GPT and msdos partition info in similar format
 A tool (partinfo) to list information about the selected
 device's partitions. Lists the following information about
 the partitions: NAME, SIZE, FSTYPE(name), FSTYPE(code), LABEL

 about GPT and msdos drive partitions. Output is formatted
 the same for both types unlike fdisk which formats it's 
 output slightly different for each type.
